    > Starter Project CLI creates a perfect Gulp development environment for everyone within a few minutes.

    ![Starter Project Logo CLI - Folder with start button and CLI keyword](/gfx/png/starter-project-cli.png)

    Starter Project CLI, or `spro`, is a command line interface that could save you a vast amount of time that you usually spend on configuring your project.

    It has Gulp tasks for processing the following file types:
    * HTML (pug)
    * CSS (Sass)
    * JavaScript (es6)
    * Graphic (PNG, JPEG, SVG, GIF)
    * Fonts
    * Favicons

    The tasks include compiling, lintering, formatting, compressing, and transforming your source file to produce the most optimized production files.

    __If you would like to add a Gulp task, feel free to open [a pull request], or request a feature by creating [a new issue].__

    ## Installation

    You could use Starter Project CLI as a global or local package.

    To install the package locally, run:
    ```
    npm install starter-project-cli --save
    ```

    To install the package globally, run:
    ```
    npm install --global starter-project-cli --save
    ```

    ## Getting started

    After successful installation, you could run the `spro` command. If you have installed the package locally, you could initialize the package by running the following command:
    ```
    node_modules/.bin/spro start
    ```

    If you have installed the package globally, you could initialize the package by running the following command:
    ```
    spro start
    ```

    Starter Project CLI would prompt you to ask a few questions about the project structure.

    Once you answer all questions, Starter Project CLI would do two things:
    - copy all required files (Gulp task files and configuration files), and
    - install all dependencies for the project.

    _Note that the install process should last a few minutes. Do not terminate the process._

    ## Gulp tasks

    In the `gulpfile.js` folder you could find all Gulp task files and configuration files.

    There are three major Gulp tasks:
    | Task      | Description                                                                                     |
    | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `default` | the task for running and watching all the tasks (useful for more thorough development process)  |
    | `build`   | the task for running all tasks with the exit process (useful for Netlify builds)                |
    | `dev`     | the task for running and watching only essential tasks (useful for primary development process) |

    There are four other Gulp tasks:

    | Task        | Description                                                    |
    | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `bumpPatch` | the task for bumping patch versions of the `package.json` file |
    | `bumpMinor` | the task for bumping minor versions of the `package.json` file |
    | `bumpMajor` | the task for bumping major versions of the `package.json` file |
    | `clean`     | the task for deleting compiled code.                           |

    Run `gulp --tasks` to see all available Gulp tasks.

    ## Configuration file

    If you want more control over your Gulp tasks, you could find the configuration files for every single Gulp task in the `gulpfile.js` folder.

    `.starter-project.json` is the main configuration file in which you could find all your answers from the command line. Avoid editing this file manually, unless you know what you are doing. Run `spro start` command again instead.

    For example, if you have more dependencies for your Sass files, you could update the `sassConfig.includePaths` section in the `.css.json` file:
    ```
    {
      "sassConfig": {
        "includePaths": [
          "helpers.proot/node_modules/modularscale-sass/stylesheets/",
          "helpers.proot/node_modules/sass-mq/",
          "helpers.proot/node_modules/normalize.css/",
          "helpers.source/config.css.src/",
          "helpers.source/config.css.src/components/"
        ]
      },
      "styleLintConfig": {
        "reporters": [{
          "formatter": "string",
          "console": true
        }]
      },
      "autoprefixerConfig": {
        "browsers": ["last 5 versions"],
        "cascade": false
      },
      "renameConfig": {
        "suffix": ".min"
      }
    }
    ```

    ### Path Placeholders

    You could notice _path placeholders_ such as `helpers.proot` and `config.css.src`.

    The package would replace all path placeholders with settings from the main config file, `.starter-project.json` file.

    **Use path placeholders to avoid hardcoding paths in the project.**

    Here is the list of all available path placeholders:
    | Placeholder        | Replacement                         |
    | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
    | `helpers.proot`    | project root path                   |
    | `helpers.source`   | project source path                 |
    | `helpers.dist`     | project destination path            |
    | `config.html.src`  | project HTML source path            |
    | `config.html.dist` | project HTML source path            |
    | `config.css.src`   | project CSS source path             |
    | `config.css.dist ` | project CSS destination path        |
    | `config.js.src`    | project JavaScript source path      |
    | `config.js.dist`   | project JavaScript destination path |

    ## Command

    Starter Project CLI package has only one command:
    - `spro start`, `spro s`.

    Also, you could run `spro --version` to check the version of the package.
